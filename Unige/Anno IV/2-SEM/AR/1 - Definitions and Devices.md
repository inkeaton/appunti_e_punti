+ **Extended Reality** (ER) is a term that refers to all kind of immersive experiences
+ Some subcategories are:
	+ **Augmented Reality** (AR): Mixing real world elements with static virtual elements
	+ **Mixed Reality** (MR): Mixing real world elements with dynamic virtual elements
	+ **Virtual Reality** (VR): Immersing the user in a completely CG world
---
+ When talking about AR, there are **multiple kinds of devices** which enable the process:
	+ Head Mounted Displays (HMD)
	+ Smart Glasses
	+ Handheld Devices
	+ Holographic Displays
+ Depending on how the augmentations are mixed with reality, there are different categories:
	+ When this combination of real and virtual content happens via a lens through which the user is viewing the environment, the result is described as a **see-through display**
	+ If the augmentations are projected onto actual physical geometry (be it dummy placeholder objects or natural parts of the real world), the technology is described as spatial AR, projection-based AR, or **spatial projection**
+ **Optical see-through** (OST) displays rely on a semitransparent mirror to mix the images. 
	+ An important **fault** is the **poor contrast** of the image, which highly depends on the environment's light
+ **Video see-through** (VST) displays achive the union electronically, mixing the CG elements with ones captured from cameras, and showing the final results on a display. 
	+ An important **fault** is the distortion of the space, which creates **poor depth perception** and **chromatic aberration**
	+ This can be **partly solved** by pre-distorting the original image to counter the lens's curvature
+ **Spatial Projection** (SAR) is achieved by projecting using a light projector on a real surface, achieving a volumetric 3D display

+ In order to achieve a good image, it's important to **consider** a lot of the special **kinks** of the **human visual system**
+ An example is the **field of view**. The human's eyes' is 200-220Â°, quite large, and **difficultly achievable** with an headset, creating a weird feeling
+ The **fovea** is the only part of the human eye with the better visual acuity, the quality drops down quite fast from there. Using **eye tracking systems**, it is possible to consider it to reduce the screen resolution where not needed, **saving performance**
+ The human system perceives **perspective** and **distance** using a system described by the **Pinhole Perspective Equation**
+ The eyes are able to **regulate** the amount of **light** entering the eye, changing the **visibility** depending on the environment. A display needs to accomodate for that
+ The presences of **two eyes** enables perceiving **binocular depth**. The only way to simulate it is to use **two different displays**
